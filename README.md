# pitcher-auto-alpha

This program analyzes Trackman baseball pitch data, which is aggregated by pitcher, and generates a detailed report in PDF format for each pitcher. The program expects the data to be in CSV format with specific columns present.

# Important!!!
You must replace 'SOU_GOL' in the filter out pitchers from the specific team line with your team idenfifier or the program will not work!!!!
